-- SUBQUERIES & NESTED LOGIC PRACTICE
-- =========================================================

-- Q1) Scalar subquery (AVG benchmark):
--     List products priced above the overall average product price.
--     Return product_id, name, price.
select product_id, name, price
from products
where price > (select avg(price) from products)
;
 
-- Q2) Scalar subquery (MAX within category):
--     Find the most expensive product(s) in the 'Beans' category.
--     (Return all ties if more than one product shares the max price.)
--     Return product_id, name, price.
select prod_id, prod_name, max_price, prod_price 
from 
(
select p.product_id as prod_id, p.name as prod_name, max(p.price) as max_price, max(p.price) over (partition by c.name) as prod_price 
from products p
join categories c on p.category_id = c.category_id
where c.name = "Beans"
group by p.product_id
order by p.price desc
) prod_max
where max_price = prod_price
;

-- Q3) List subquery (IN with nested lookup):
--     List customers who have purchased at least one product in the 'Merch' category.
--     Return customer_id, first_name, last_name.
--     Hint: Use a subquery to find the category_id for 'Merch', then a subquery to find product_ids.

-- Q4) List subquery (NOT IN / anti-join logic):
--     List products that have never been ordered (their product_id never appears in order_items).
--     Return product_id, name, price.

-- Q5) Table subquery (derived table + compare to overall average):
--     Build a derived table that computes total_units_sold per product
--     (SUM(order_items.quantity) grouped by product_id).
--     Then return only products whose total_units_sold is greater than the
--     average total_units_sold across all products.
--     Return product_id, product_name, total_units_sold.
