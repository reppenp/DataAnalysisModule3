-- ADVANCED SQL ASSIGNMENT
-- Subqueries, CTEs, Window Functions, Views
-- =========================================================
-- Notes:
-- - Unless a question says otherwise, use orders with status = 'paid'.
-- - Write ONE query per prompt.
-- - Keep results readable (use clear aliases, ORDER BY where it helps).

-- =========================================================
-- Q1) Correlated subquery: Above-average order totals (PAID only)
-- =========================================================
-- For each PAID order, compute order_total (= SUM(quantity * products.price)).
-- Return: order_id, customer_name, store_name, order_datetime, order_total.
-- Filter to orders where order_total is greater than the average PAID order_total
-- for THAT SAME store (correlated subquery).
-- Sort by store_name, then order_total DESC.
with store_orders as
(
select orderid, customer_name, store_name, orderdate, order_total, avg(order_total) over(partition by store_name) as average_order
from
(select orderid, customer_name, store_name, orderdate, sum(line_total) as order_total
from
(
select o.order_id as orderid, oi.order_item_id, o.status, concat(c.first_name, " ", c.last_name) as customer_name, s.name as store_name, 
o.order_datetime as orderdate, oi.quantity as quantity, p.price, (oi.quantity * p.price) as line_total 
from order_items oi
join orders o on oi.order_id = o.order_id
join products p on oi.product_id = p.product_id
join customers c on o.customer_id = c.customer_id
join stores s on o.store_id = s.store_id
where o.status = "Paid"
) order1
group by store_name, customer_name, orderid, orderdate
) order2
) 
select *
from store_orders
where order_total > average_order
;

-- =========================================================
-- Q2) CTE: Daily revenue and 3-day rolling average (PAID only)
-- =========================================================
-- Using a CTE, compute daily revenue per store:
--   revenue_day = SUM(quantity * products.price) grouped by store_id and DATE(order_datetime).
-- Then, for each store and date, return:
--   store_name, order_date, revenue_day,
--   rolling_3day_avg = average of revenue_day over the current day and the prior 2 days.
-- Use a window function for the rolling average.
-- Sort by store_name, order_date.

-- =========================================================
-- Q3) Window function: Rank customers by lifetime spend (PAID only)
-- =========================================================
-- Compute each customer's total spend across ALL stores (PAID only).
-- Return: customer_id, customer_name, total_spend,
--         spend_rank (DENSE_RANK by total_spend DESC).
-- Also include percent_of_total = customer's total_spend / total spend of all customers.
-- Sort by total_spend DESC.
(
select c.customer_id as cust_id, concat(c.first_name, " ", c.last_name) as customer_name,
sum(oi.quantity * p.price) as total_spend
from orders o
join customers c on o.customer_id = c.customer_id
join order_items oi on o.order_id = oi.order_id
join products p on oi.product_id = p.product_id
group by c.customer_id
)
;

-- =========================================================
-- Q4) CTE + window: Top product per store by revenue (PAID only)
-- =========================================================
-- For each store, find the top-selling product by REVENUE (not units).
-- Revenue per product per store = SUM(quantity * products.price).
-- Return: store_name, product_name, category_name, product_revenue.
-- Use a CTE to compute product_revenue, then a window function (ROW_NUMBER)
-- partitioned by store to select the top 1.
-- Sort by store_name.

-- =========================================================
-- Q5) Subquery: Customers who have ordered from ALL stores (PAID only)
-- =========================================================
-- Return customers who have at least one PAID order in every store in the stores table.
-- Return: customer_id, customer_name.
-- Hint: Compare count(distinct store_id) per customer to (select count(*) from stores).

-- =========================================================
-- Q6) Window function: Time between orders per customer (PAID only)
-- =========================================================
-- For each customer, list their PAID orders in chronological order and compute:
--   prev_order_datetime (LAG),
--   minutes_since_prev (difference in minutes between current and previous order).
-- Return: customer_name, order_id, order_datetime, prev_order_datetime, minutes_since_prev.
-- Only show rows where prev_order_datetime is NOT NULL.
-- Sort by customer_name, order_datetime.

-- =========================================================
-- Q7) View: Create a reusable order line view for PAID orders
-- =========================================================
-- Create a view named v_paid_order_lines that returns one row per PAID order item:
--   order_id, order_datetime, store_id, store_name,
--   customer_id, customer_name,
--   product_id, product_name, category_name,
--   quantity, unit_price (= products.price),
--   line_total (= quantity * products.price)
--
-- After creating the view, write a SELECT that uses the view to return:
--   store_name, category_name, revenue
-- where revenue is SUM(line_total),
-- sorted by revenue DESC.

-- =========================================================
-- Q8) View + window: Store revenue share by payment method (PAID only)
-- =========================================================
-- Create a view named v_paid_store_payments with:
--   store_id, store_name, payment_method, revenue
-- where revenue is total PAID revenue for that store/payment_method.
--
-- Then query the view to return:
--   store_name, payment_method, revenue,
--   store_total_revenue (window SUM over store),
--   pct_of_store_revenue (= revenue / store_total_revenue)
-- Sort by store_name, revenue DESC.

-- =========================================================
-- Q9) CTE: Inventory risk report (low stock relative to sales)
-- =========================================================
-- Identify items where on_hand is low compared to recent demand:
-- Using a CTE, compute total_units_sold per store/product for PAID orders.
-- Then join inventory to that result and return rows where:
--   on_hand < total_units_sold
-- Return: store_name, product_name, on_hand, total_units_sold, units_gap (= total_units_sold - on_hand)
-- Sort by units_gap DESC.
