-- Q2) Compute total items per order for PAID orders only.
--     Return (order_id, total_items). Hint: order_id IN (SELECT ... FROM orders WHERE status='paid').

--     Return (order_date, orders_count) from orders.

-- Q4) What is the average number of items per PAID order?
--     Use a subquery or CTE over order_items filtered by order_id IN (...).

    
-- Q5) Which products (by product_id) have sold the most units overall across all stores?
--     Return (product_id, total_units), sorted desc.

--     Return (product_id, total_units_paid), sorted desc.
--     Hint: order_id IN (SELECT order_id FROM orders WHERE status='paid').


-- Q7) For each store, how many UNIQUE customers have placed a PAID order?
--     Return (store_id, unique_customers) using only the orders table.

-- Q8) Which day of week has the highest number of PAID orders?
--     Return (day_name, orders_count). Hint: DAYNAME(order_datetime). Return ties if any.

-- Q9) Show the calendar days whose total orders (any status) exceed 3.
--     Use HAVING. Return (order_date, orders_count).

-- Q10) Per store, list payment_method and the number of PAID orders.

-- Q11) Among PAID orders, what percent used 'app' as the payment_method?
--      Return a single row with pct_app_paid_orders (0–100).
